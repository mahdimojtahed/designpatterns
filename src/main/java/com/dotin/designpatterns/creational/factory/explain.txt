Factory Design pattern is based on Encapsulation object oriented concept.
Factory method is used to create different object from factory often refereed as Item and it encapsulate the creation code.
So instead of having object creation code on client side we encapsulate inside Factory method in Java

Also known as Static factory method / Simple factory

Real World Example :
Imagine an alchemist who is about to manufacture coins.
The alchemist must be able to create both gold and copper coins and switching between them
must be possible without modifying the existing source code.
The factory pattern makes it possible by providing a static construction method
which can be called with relevant parameters.
